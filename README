# Iterated Differences #
Check out diffs.gif to see the effect of repeated differencing on a white noise process (i.e. sequence of normal random variables
with mean zero and homogeneous variance. If you're curious about the code you can look at gendiffplots.R, which might give you
ideas for making animations using R. The call to ImageMagick (on Mac 10.11.3) was:

convert pngs\/*.png $(DELAY) $(LOOP) $(OUTPUT) 

and can be viewed in the Makefile.

The motivation was to visualize the effects of repeated differencing of a discrete time series. The result was a complicated 
smoothing with an interesting dual structure, perhaps suggesting a connection between symmetric distributions and complex numbers.
